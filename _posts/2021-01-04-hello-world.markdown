Hello, world! I want to use this post to give a brief introduction about who I am and how this website came to be.
My name is Felix and I am a self-taught software developer who is currently studying Computer Science at
[Technical University of Munich.][1]
Besides that, I enjoy playing tennis and working on challenging side projects. 

```swift
let me = Human(name: "Felix")
me.sayHello()
```

Although I have developed websites in the past, I wanted to have a lightweight and easy solution for my 
new website that would not require too much effort to maintain.

This is when I heard about [Jekyll][2], a site-generator that simply transforms Markdown files into HTML code,
which sounded ideal for my use case. 

Theme: [Plainwhite][3]
